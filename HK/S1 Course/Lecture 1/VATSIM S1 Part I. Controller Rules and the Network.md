## Understanding of Roles of ATC

* ###### Prevent collisions between aircraft / ground obstacles

* ###### Expedite and maintain an orderly flow of air traffic

* ###### Provide advice and information for safe and efficient conduct of flight

* ###### Understand with tracking that all involved shall have as much fun as possible

* **Responsibility goes upon the traffic situation but not how aircraft is flown.**

* If situation gets unpleasant or hatred, or if pilot trying to do sabotage action, should contact to supervisor(SUP/ADM)

* Positions at higher level covers positions at lower levels if they are not in online.
* **Clearance Delivery(DEL)**: providing IFR clearance to aircraft
* **Ground(GND)**: exercising general surveillance on airport movement area
* **Tower(TWR)**: responsible for all take offs and landings and give instructions to effect proper sequencing and separation of aircraft for departure.
* **Approach(APP)**: responsible for ensuring separation between departures in the [terminal airspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_control_area) once they are handed over  from TWR.
* **Departure(DEP)**: responsible for separation within the terminal airspace
* **Area Control Center(CTR)**: provides ATC to aircraft on the en-route phase of flight.
* Flight Service Station(FSS): position not available in HK vACC. an air-traffic activity that provides a myriad of services to the pilot such as pilot brefing, relaying of clearances and broadcasting of weather information.
