  * Powered by engine, Aeroplane
  * Powered by "NO" engine at all, Glider

* Rotorcraft 회전익
  * Helicopter
  * Gyroplane (autogyro)

* Lighter-than-air
  * Airship
  * Balloon

* Microflight(MTOM < 45kg)
* Hybrid(Tilt-rotor)
* Other than one of the above

## Aircraft Types

* Aircraft Type: specific aircraft model, tells us which category it belongs to
* ICAO Aircraft Type Designator
  * B744 - Boeing 744 / C172 - Cessna 172 / A20N - Airbus A320NEO ...

## Maximum Take Off Weight (MTOW)

* Definition: Maximum weight of an aircraft at which a pilot is allowed to attempt take-off

* MTOW is very important because it is often used to determine the airworthiness(감항성) of an aircraft.

* In our case, it is used to determine to wake turbulence(항적난기류) category of an aircraft.

  > Wake turbulence is a turbulence in the atmosphere that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air. It includes various components, the most important of which are wingtip vortices and jetwash.

* An aircraft is certified for structural and performance requirements at or below its MTOW. A pilot shall always keep the weight of the aircraft below MTOW to ensure safe flight.

## Propulsion of Aircraft

* Powered fixed-wing aeroplane in the modern days usually have one of the following 3 types of engine.
  * Reciprocating Engines (왕복 엔진)
    * commonly found on most small General Aviation(GA) aircraft
    * operating by converting chemical energy (fuel) into mechanical energy by combustions with the cylinders
  * Turboprep Engines
  * Turbojet/Turbofan Engines
    * Turbofan engine would provide an aircraft with a higher service ceiling over other engines.

## Questions

1. Which of these aircraft types would you expect to cruise at Mach .78-.80?

* Mach .78 = 828km/h while Mach 80 = 913km/h

5. Which one of these factors affect indicated airspeed?

   > Indicated airspeed = 대기속도. 비표준 상태나 오차(공기밀도, 계기, 자세변화 등)을 고려하기 이전의 속도.
