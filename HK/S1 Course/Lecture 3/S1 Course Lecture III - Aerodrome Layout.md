 ## Movement Area vs Manoeuvring Area

* Movement Area = Manoeuvring area + APRON

  * https://studyflying.com/

  * Maneuvering Area:

    The part of an aerodrome to be used for the takeoff, landing and taxiing of aircraft, excluding APRONs.

  * APRON:

    APRON - a defined area, on a land aerodrome, intended to accommodate aircraft for purposes of loading and unloading passengers, mail or cargo, fueling (ground operations), parking or maintenance.

## Taxiways

* Connect runways to the apron, the terminal, the hangar and other parts of the aerodrome
* Mostly paved with asphalt or concrete, but at smaller airports they can be unpaved, leaving a surface or gravel or grass.
* No standard speed limit for a specific taxiway. Aircraft manufacturers have recommended taxi speed for each specific aircraft type.
* For larger jet, usual taxi speed would be around 20~30 knots taxiing straight forward.
* High speed taxiway: permitting aircraft to taxi at a higher speed than normal for rapid exiting.

## Signs and Markings

## Runways

* Rectangular area at a land aerodrome designated for takeoffs and landings of fixed-wing aircraft

* Either paved surface, including concrete or asphalt, or unpaved surface (including grass)

* Runway designations come from the magnetic azimuth of the runway heading in decadegree.

  * Rounding off to the nearest 10 degrees.

  * Example

    * If the runway's magnetic heading is 183 degrees, then it would be rounded off to 18, called runway one-eight.
    * The other end of the runway, coming from the exact opposite direction, would be runway 36, called runway thirty-six.
    * A runway with a magnetic heading of 067 degrees would be runway 07,  "runway zero-seven". To simplify runway numbers, any runway that has a magnetic heading between 010 degrees and 090 degrees is designated with a single number. You would see "7" painted on the runway and would also  be referred to as "runway seven".
    * At many airports, especially large ones, you will see parallel runways.  This can be just one more parallel, or four and more! If there is just one more parallel runway, than these two parallel runways will be  designated with  a "L" for the left runway, and a "R" for the right. The left and right is in reference to the direction you are landing or taking off. For example, if the runways are 180 degrees, than we could  be using either "runway one-eight left" or "one-eight right" for runway  designations.
    * While there are many exceptions to east-west runways, generally speaking prevailing winds (which blow from a single direction) blow east-west rather than north-south.
    * If there are three parallel runways, then the runway in the middle would be designated with a "C" for center. Therefore, we could be using  "runway one-eight left", "runway one-eight right", or "runway one-eight center".
    * Sometimes runway designation may increase or decrease by 10 degrees so that the parallel runways would have runway designations that are consecutive numbers.

    ## Holding Short of a Runway

    * Pilots are to hold short of a runway unless the air-traffic controller has given specific instructions to enter or across a runway.
    * Runway holding position marking: two solid lines closer to the runway and two dotted lines farther away from the runway.
    * Purpose of ILS Holding Point: Holding short of the runway at certain positions may interfere with theoperation of ILS as the aircraft will be located in the ILS critical area.

    ## LAHSO

    * Land and Hold Short Operations
    * possible cases
      * Land and hold short of an intersecting runway
      * Land and hold short of an intersecting taxiway
      * Land and hold short of a designated point on a runway other than an intersecting runway or taxiway.
    * ATC may clear LAHSO if certain weather minimums, and runway lengths are available, among other considerations.
    * The pilot-in-command has the final authority to accept or decline any land and short clearance.
    * A pilot who accepts a LAHSO clearance should land and exit the runway at the first convenient runway (unless directed otherwise) before reaching the hold short point.
